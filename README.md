Git and GitHub
Creating Repositories - Authoring 1

Assignment Description:
You will be building a Github Repository for each of your homework assignments for
Authoring 1. Use these repositories to complete the requirements for each assignment. After
the initial submission, you DO NOT NEED TO RESUBMIT to FOL. Just update the main
branch with pull requests, commits and merges.

Assignment Requirements:
Create a repository on Github for each homework assignment (refer to the appropriate
section in the course content for number of assignment repos youâ€™ll need).
Add the required content to the Readme file, using the template provided as a reference.
Make sure to implement these edits on a new branch - NEVER work directly on the main
branch.

Create the correct project structure - files and folders - for each assignment.

Push the changes to your repo and merge those changes to the main branch.

Submit your Github repo link to FOL.

Submission:
Homework must be submitted by Class of Week 5 at 530PM (EST)
- Github repo named correctly (lastName_firstInitial_HW1):
- readme.md file
- main branch
- development branch(es)
- Name the branches appropriately per feature IE des.tvr.artwork, dev.tvr.script
- Correct structure for a web project (css, js, images and index.html)
Submit the repo link via FOL dropbox
DO NOT SUBMIT ZIPPED FILES
ONLY THE MAIN BRANCH WILL BE GRADED

Additional Information:
Missed tests/exams will not be rescheduled without some valid evidence of some important
event over which the student has no control (e.g., Court appearance, death in the family).
Missed tests or exams, therefore, can receive a zero. The students are advised to notify the
professor prior to missing the test.

Students are expected to hand in all assignments to the course instructor on the due date,
and all assignments must be submitted in the format specified by the instructor (e.g., on
FOL, in printed form, on a specific lab computer, etc.); assignments will not be accepted in
any format other than that specified.

Late assignments will not be accepted, nor will make up test or assignments be permitted,
without some valid evidence of some important event over which the student has no control
(e.g., documented illness, death in the family). Missed tests or assignments, therefore, will
receive a mark of zero. Late assignments and make-up tests will only be permitted following
the submission of adequate documentation acceptable to the instructor (e.g., a doctor's
note). Students are advised to notify the instructor prior to missing an assignment due date
or a scheduled test.

Immediately upon return from an illness/absence in which a test or assignment has been
missed, the student is responsible for contacting the course instructor to discuss the
problem. The instructor will make arrangements for any student deemed eligible. The
alternative test/assignment will be of equal value to the one missed with no grade penalty.
The timeline and due dates will be determined by the course instructor.
At mid-term, any unsatisfactory results will be reported to the student.
This course may be revised by the professor with suitable notification to the students.
Students are responsible for making arrangements to pick up missed handouts, assignments
and course announcements from classmates.

Plagiarism (e.g., failure to acknowledge sources used, submitting another student's work
under your name, or producing work for another student to submit) is a serious academic
offense that shall result in appropriate penalties, to be determined at the discretion of the
course professor in consultation with the chairperson of the Communication Arts division.
The penalties shall range from failure of an assignment to possible failure of the course.
Students shall not make the assumption that any provision will be made by the professor to
permit the student to rewrite or redo failed assignments
